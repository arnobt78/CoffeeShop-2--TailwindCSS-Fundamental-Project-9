## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**  
   Visit the local URL shown in the terminal (usually <http://localhost:5173>).

4. **Build for production:**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

---

## How to Reuse Components

Each component is self-contained and can be imported into other React projects:

```jsx
import Hero from './components/Hero/Hero';
import Services from './components/Services/Services';
// ...etc
```

- **Props:** Most components are data-driven. For example, to add a new service, edit the `ServicesData` array in `Services.jsx`.
- **Styling:** All styles use Tailwind CSS classes, so you can easily adjust themes via `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Assets:** Place your images in `src/assets/` and update import paths as needed.

---

## Customization & Theming

- **Colors & Fonts:** Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change primary/secondary colors or font families.
- **Animations:** Adjust AOS settings in `App.jsx` or per component.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle dark mode by adding/removing the `dark` class on the `<body>` or root div.
